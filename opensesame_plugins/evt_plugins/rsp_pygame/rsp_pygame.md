# rsp_pygame
Plugin to collect input from a Joystick a RSP-12x responsebox or from a generic keyboard.

The RSP_PYGAME plugin handles input from RSP-12x devices. rsp_pygame uses the joystick module of the PyGame library for flawless integration with OpenSesame 4. Please use the PyGame engine for the OpenSesame project.

## Connecting multiple RSP-12x (or EVT-x) devices
In the device selection tab, select the right device number. The RSP-12x ID-numbers displayed, are in random order, but will remain the same as long devices are not plugged in or out during the session! Test your program to make sure you are using the right input device.

## Options and response variables

The RSP_PYGAME plugin works analogously to the KEYBOARD_RESPONSE item. For more information, see the KEYBOARD_RESPONSE-item help or visit:
