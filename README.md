## 1. About
The BSS Research Support OpenSesame Plugin Collection for use with Event Exchanger (EVT-2) USB-devices.

EVT-devices and the associated plugins are developed by the [Research Support](https://myuniversity.rug.nl/infonet/medewerkers/profiles/departments/11422) department from the faculty of Behavioural and Social Sciences from the University of Groningen.

The currently supported OpenSesame version is: 4.

The following plugins are available:

### Package dependencies
The plugins are dependent on the Python module pyevt and the underlying hidapi package.

[https://pypi.org/project/hidapi/](https://pypi.org/project/hidapi/)

*pyevt* and *hidapi* are installed from the Python Console in OpenSesame with the single command:

`!pip install --user pyevt`

NOTE: Currently, the plugin package is released as pip package in a test environment. Clone this repository and copy the plugins manually into your OpenSesame python package folder or temporary install from the command line in OpenSesame 4 with:

```
!pip install --user hidapi
!pip install --user --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pyevt
!pip install --user --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ evt-plugins
```

### Environmental settings
By default, the OpenSesame 4.0 plugins are installed as python site-package and automatically loaded at the startup.
When the plugins are located somewhere else, add your path to the python-path of OpenSesame in the `environment.yaml` file in the OpenSesame program directory (The OPENSESAME_plugin_PATH is old style). See for the instructions here: [https://rapunzel.cogsci.nl/manual/environment/](https://rapunzel.cogsci.nl/manual/environment/) 

## 2. Plugin Descriptions

*evt_trigger*

Existing modes:

- Clear output lines
- Write output line
- Invert output lines
- Pulse output lines

*response_box*

Collects responses from a 1 to 8 button RSP-12x response box.

After the prepare phase of the plugin, a workspace variable `connected_device_plugin_instance_name` is created to check if the actual tactile-stimulator device is really detected and connected to the plugin.

*rsp_pygame*

This response-box plugin works for EVT devices as well for joystick devices. It makes use of the pygame joystick API and is platform independent. 

*tactile_stimulator*

The tactile_stimulator plugin operates in two modes. Usually two instances of this plugin are used in the OpenSesame experiment. Mode-I, the `Calibration`-mode should always precede the `Stimulate`-mode. In `Calibration`-mode the upper limit of stimulus-current threshold is set between 0 and 5mA rms. In the `Stimulate`-mode, a percentage of the stimulus-current upper limit is set to be applied to the subject. The `Calibration`-mode can be used standalone for instance to precondition the subject. The pulse duration can be extended up to 2000ms.

After the prepare phase of the plugin, a workspace variable `connected_device_plugin_instance_name` is created to check if the actual tactile-stimulator device is really detected and connected to the plugin.

Here below follows a list of variables that appear in the OpenSesame variable inspector when using the tactile_stimulator plugin:

variable name | description
------------- | -----------
`tactstim_calibration_perc` | The percentage of the slider setting for the stimulus current of up to 5mA rms max.
`tactstim_calibration_milliamp` | The calibration value of the stimulus current in mA's. This is the max. current applied to the subject.
`tactstim_calibration_value`| The byte value representation of the calibrated current.
`tactstim_pulse_milliamp` | The actual current in mA's, applied to the subject when pulsing.
`tactstim_pulse_value` | The actual byte value representation that is sent to the tactile stimulator.
`tactstim_pulse_duration_ms` | The pulse duration time in ms.
`tactstim_time_last_pulse` | Unique time stamp in seconds from the moment of the shock.

*vas_evt*

A Visual Analog Slider plugin controlled by an EVT rotary or linear encoder.
The *vas_evt* plugin does not work standalone, but requires a linkage to a custom designed sketchpad screen.

*vas_gui*

A Visual Analog Slider plugin. The *vas_gui* plugin does not work standalone, but requires a linkage to a custom designed sketchpad screen with an analog slider design!

Here below is the list of the variables that will appear in the OpenSesame variable inspector when using the vas_gui plugin:

variable name | description
------------- | -----------
`vas_response` | This value is the reading from the VAS object, ranging from 0 to 100.
`vas_response_time` | this is the repsonse time in ms. The value -1 means that the timeout period was reached.

*rgb_led_control*

This plugin works for the RSP-LT device, a response-box with RGB-controlled LED buttons.
